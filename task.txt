Overview: You will build a sophisticated Task Management System (TMS) designed to handle project and task tracking, along with advanced features like AI-powered task prioritization, real-time collaboration, and resource allocation optimization.

Core Features:

User Authentication and Roles: -- check[x]

Implement user authentication with roles (Admin, Manager, Employee). --- check[x]

Integrate NextAuth for third-party authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.).  check[x]

Task and Project Management:

Users can create tasks, assign them to team members, and define task deadlines. --- check[x]

Each task has customizable fields (Priority, Status, Estimated Time, etc.). --- check[x]

Tasks are organized within projects, and each project can have different workflows.  --- check this once because task should organised in project 

Drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering and status updates (Kanban board view). -- check[x]

AI-Powered Task Prioritization:

Use an AI model (possibly GPT-4 or a custom model) to automatically suggest task prioritization based on factors such as urgency, dependencies, and historical task completion data.

AI should learn from user feedback (e.g., if a task is marked as "high priority" repeatedly, the model should adjust).

Time Tracking and Resource Allocation:

Implement an advanced time-tracking system that tracks the time users spend on each task.

Generate reports for managers on time spent, pending tasks, and team performance.

Use machine learning to optimize task allocation based on team members' strengths and historical performance.



Advanced Reporting and Analytics:

Implement real-time project dashboards with task completion rates, timelines, and workload distribution.

Managers can generate custom reports (e.g., performance, resource usage, project progress).

Use data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js) to represent data visually.

Integrations:

Integrate with popular tools like Trello, Jira, GitHub, Slack, or Google Calendar.

Allow task creation and status synchronization with other platforms.
