1. when i logged in successfully and click on logout it clear the access token as well as cookies 
2. when i logged in successfully and click on reload and when i click on logout it logged out because 
   -  in public route 
          i remove the condition 
          if token ? "/" : <Login/>


         but when i add this condition the path stays on dashboard which is correct 
         if token ? "/" : <Login/>

         and then i click on logout it throws an error 
           ```
           false false '..........auth status........'
